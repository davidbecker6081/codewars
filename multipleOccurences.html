    <p>Given a list lst and a number N, create a new list that contains each number of lst at most N times without reordering. For example if N = 2, and the input is [1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3], you take [1,2,3,1,2], drop the next [1,2] since this would lead to 1 and 2 being in the result 3 times, and then take 3, which leads to [1,2,3,1,2,3].</p>
    <p>Example: deleteNth ([1,1,1,1],2) // return [1,1]</p>
    <p>deleteNth ([20,37,20,21],1) // return [20,37,21]</p>
    <script type="text/javascript">
    function deleteNth(arr, n) {
      const counts = {};
      
      return arr.filter((number) => {
        counts[number] = (counts[number]||0) + 1;
        return counts[number] <= n;
      });
    }
